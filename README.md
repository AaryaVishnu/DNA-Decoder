# DNA-Decoder
Personal Python project for DNA sequence analysis
This basic code parses through DNA sequences. It outputs the complementary RNA sequence of the input sequence and gives nucleotide counts of both the RNA and DNA sequences.
Two sequence input methods can be chosen, the console or through a file. The console is best for smaller DNA sequences.
Additionally, if the sequence is inputted through a file, the input file and name of the output file can be chosen.
